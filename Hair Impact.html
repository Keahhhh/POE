              Queen B' is also widely known for her passion for healthy, beautiful hair. She has a unique relationship with her hair, stemming from her mother, <em>Tina Knowles</em>, who worked as a hairdresser in the early stages of her life. This relationship blossomed into a deep appreciation for hair care and styling.

              Beyoncé is especially known for her signature honey brown and honey blonde hair. She was one of the first to popularize these warm-toned highlights, and though many have tried to replicate her look, no one does it quite like her.
