            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>
                Beyoncé Giselle Knowles was born at the Park Plaza Hospital in Houston, Texas, on September 4, 1981.
                She grew up in a family of four with her mother Tina Knowles, her father Matthew Knowles, and sister
                <a href="https://www.biography.com/musicians/solange">Solange</a>,
                <i><b>who is also a singer, actress, songwriter, and producer in the industry.</b></i>
                <br><br>
                She started performing before the age of 9 and won 35 local talent competitions. At age 9, she began
                taking singing lessons with an opera vocal teacher, and by 10, her father began training her to sing and
                dance simultaneously.

                Solange told <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/beyonce-cover-story-interview-gq-february-2013"><em>GQ</em></a>
                that Beyoncé never wanted to rest. She always rehearsed until it met her high standards—even practicing alone in her room.

            <p>
                Before Destiny's Child became the 21st century’s most notable girl group, Beyoncé and her childhood best friend
                <a href="https://www.biography.com/musicians/kelly-rowland">Kelly Rowland</a> started a group called
                <em>Girl's Tyme</em>. They gained attention on a talent show but lost despite their talent.
                Beyoncé’s father eventually left his job to become their full-time manager.
